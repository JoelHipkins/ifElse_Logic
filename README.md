We have a coffee shop website which offers different menus for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. To make it easier for visitors to quickly get to the menu
for the current time of day, weâ€™ll add a link to the appropriate menu. That will
require us to get the current hour and then create a link to the appropriate menu.
